For the K-S test, use both 1-sample and 2-sample tests. For the 1-sample test, try Poisson, Geometric, and Binomial. To obtain parameters of these distributions to check against in 1-sample KS, use MME on the Oct-Dec 2020 data of the first state in your dataset to obtain parameters of the distribution, and then check whether the Oct-Dec 2020 data for the second state in your dataset has the distribution with the obtained MME parameters. For the permutation test, use 1000 permutations. Use a threshold of 0.05 for both K-S test and Permutation test.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"MQCILvgPhARt"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","from scipy.stats import poisson\n","from scipy.stats import geom\n","from scipy.stats import binom"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YV5w863ZhARw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1620966229168,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":345,"user":{"displayName":"Anurag Yepuri","photoUrl":"","userId":"17448243059250590647"}},"outputId":"4229425a-4198-4371-92cc-3197eabe3e89"},"source":["#%cd D:\\StonyBrook\\Study\\Prob&Stats CSE544\\Project\n","\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/gdrive')\n","\n","%cd /content/gdrive/My Drive/Prob_stats_proj"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/gdrive;
